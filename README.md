# Hi Neil

**This prototype was built using the [Foundation for Sites](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html) framework.**

You may have to **run a local server environment** for some of the javascript to work. I used "http-server" installed via the node package manager.

## You need to have...

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)


### How to get going...

Download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhirajsapkal/thesis_final.git
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd thesis_final
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run `foundation-watch` or `npm-start` to run the Sass compiler. It will re-run every time you save a Sass file. (in case you want to tweak my code for some reason)
